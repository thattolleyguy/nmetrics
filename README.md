# NMetrics

*Capturing CLR and application-level metrics. So you know what's going on.*


####This work is a fork of @danielcrenna's Metrics.NET heavily modified to bring the interfaces inline with the current [dropwizard/metrics] (https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) library.####

Introduction
------------

This library is still currently in beta as the interface continues to change to match the original java library. .Net specific documentation is forthcoming but the java [documentation] (http://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/) be helpful for reference.
